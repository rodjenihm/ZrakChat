# ZrakChat  
Simple web-based chat application made for fun and studying purposes  
It allows users to register, login, add other users to contacts list and chat with them  

Back-End:  
-ASP.NET Core 3.1 WebApi  
-SQL Server DBMS  
-Dapper micro-ORM  
-ASP.NET CORE SignalR (for real time messaging)

Front-End:  
-Angular 9  

In the future I will hopefully add more advanced functionalities like voice messages, video chat, file sharing etc...
